### Types of Flow Meter

* **Displacement Meter**

{: .box-note}
A positive displacement meter is a type of flow meter that requires fluid to mechanically displace components in the meter in order for flow measurement. Positive displacement (PD) flow meters measure the volumetric flow rate of a moving fluid or gas by dividing the media into fixed, metered volumes (finite increments or volumes of the fluid)


* **Velocity-based Meter**

	- Electromagnetic Meter
	- **Ultrasonic Meter**

### Ultrasonic Meters
- Doppler effect meter

The Doppler Effect Ultrasonic Flow meter use reflected ultrasonic sound to measure the fluid velocity. By measuring the frequency shift between the ultrasonic frequency source, the receiver, and the fluid carrier, the relative motion are measured.
The resulting frequency shift is named the Doppler Effect.
