### Brief introduction

{: .box-note}
**T**he design process represented in this project simplifies design, implementation, code generation and also software testing (MIL and PIL) for robotic applications. Algorithm designers can design their model in MATLAB/Simulink and run model-in-the-loop simulation on Gazebo based on ROS. When the test procedure is done, the generated code can be placed on the target SBC.
